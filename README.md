# Examining the Representativeness of OSM Bicycle Infrastructure in U.S. Cities

## About
This project compares OSM and local agency bikeway datasets to demonstrate how linear features that are only approximatly aligned can be geometrically conflated. This process is sometimes also called "map matching."

## Contents

- `Final Project.md` : Markdown version of `Bikeway Comparison.ipynb`
- `compare_bikeways.py` : Module of project-specific Python scripts
